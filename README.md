## How to install (patched btcd version)
```
Install patched btcd node client https://github.com/1F47E/btcd-fork2
Edit config to have index=1 if you want to get info about all tx, not only mempool

Testnet
/root/go/bin/btcd -u rpcuser -P rpcpass --testnet

Mainnet
/root/go/bin/btcd -u rpcuser -P rpcpass

Full mainnet sync can take up to a week.
```

## rawmempool patch
```
In order to have realtime mempool info with tx fee right from the node - it should be patched.
By default getrawmempool returns unsorted list of transactions, hash only.
After patch it will return full tx info in a sorted array by time.
```
